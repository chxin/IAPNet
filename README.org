* IAPNet
 #+BEGIN_CENTER An awesome IAP project with different implements. #+END_CENTER
** About the Project
*** Introduction
    In Application Programming (IAP) is a way to program computer logic devices while they are being operated by the system.
    IAPNet implements different communication techniques for STM32F10x, including Field bus, wire, and wireless communications.
*** Built With
    - Embedded-C
*** Project Structure
